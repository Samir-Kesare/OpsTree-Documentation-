 ## Introduction

The concept of “Drift in Infrastructure as Code (IaC)” refers to the phenomenon that occurs when the intended state of the infrastructure diverges from the actual state of the infrastructure. This divergence can be brought about by various factors, including manual alterations made to the infrastructure by a human operator, changes made to the IaC configuration itself, or applications that make the changes. As a result, drift can have significant implications for the availability, security, and performance of the infrastructure.

## What is Drift?

Drift occurs when the actual state of the infrastructure diverges from what’s defined in the Terraform configurations. This divergence can occur due to manual changes, external processes, or resource modifications. Since the possible implications of drift are potentially catastrophic, drift detection in IaC collaboration tools such as Digger is sometimes a hard compliance requirement for companies.
