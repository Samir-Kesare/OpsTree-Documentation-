## What is Terraform Module?
A Terraform module is a collection of standard configuration files stored in a dedicated directory. Modules encapsulate groups of resources dedicated to specific tasks, reducing the amount of code needed for similar infrastructure components.
Modules are containers for multiple resources used together in a configuration. They package and reuse resource configurations, making it easier to manage and scale infrastructure as it grows.

## what is CI/CD?
**Continuous Integration (CI)** is a software development practice that automates the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a shared software project repository. 
Automation and Integration: CI automates the process of integrating code changes frequently into a central repository, facilitating faster merging of code changes and ensuring their correctness through automated testing.

**Continuous deployment and delivery (CD)** is a software development practice that aims to automate the integration, testing, and delivery of code changes. It is a two-part process that involves continuous delivery and continuous deployment.

| Aspect                  | Continuous Delivery (CD)                                                                                                                                                                  | Continuous Deployment (CD)                                                                                                                              |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Definition              | An extension of continuous integration. It automates the release of validated code to a repository following the automation of builds and unit and integration tests.                       | A logical continuation of the practice of automating build and test steps. If a build passes all previous stages in the pipeline successfully, it is automatically released to production.                  |
| Deployment Process      | Each successful build is automatically deployed to pre-production environments (e.g., testing and acceptance testing environments) for QA and product professionals to verify changes. | As soon as any change to the software has passed all tests, it is automatically delivered to users, shortening the feedback loop from code change to use in production.                                 |
| Goal                    | Helps teams release software faster, shorten the feedback loop, and automate repetitive tasks.                                                                                             | Shortens the feedback loop from code change to use in production, providing timely insight into how changes perform in the real world without compromising quality.                                         |
| Automation              | Automates the release of validated code following successful builds and tests.                                                                                                             | Automates the release of code to production as soon as all tests have passed, eliminating manual intervention in the deployment process.                                                                              |
| Usage                   | Suitable for scenarios where a manual approval step is needed before deploying changes to production.                                                                                      | Suitable for scenarios where rapid deployment of changes to production is desired and where automated testing ensures the quality of changes before release.                                                   |
| Feedback                | Provides feedback through pre-production environments, allowing QA and product professionals to verify changes before release.                                                            | Provides timely feedback on how changes perform in the real world by deploying them directly to production, enabling quick iteration and improvement based on user feedback.                               |


## Terraform Module CI/CD: Automating Module Deployment
In the context of Terraform, combining Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices with modules allows for the automated testing, building, and deployment of Terraform modules. 
**CI/CD for Terraform Modules:** Integrating CI/CD practices with Terraform modules involves automating the process of uploading modules to the official Terraform registry. This automation streamlines the deployment of infrastructure configurations and ensures consistency in module publishing.

## Terraform CI

For Terraform CI, I am utilizing a comprehensive set of tools to ensure code quality, consistency, and security throughout the development process. These tools include:

| Tool             | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Terraform fmt    | Automatically formats Terraform configuration files (.tf files) to ensure consistent styling and layout.                                                                   |
| Terraform validate | Verifies whether the configuration files are syntactically correct and internally consistent. It checks for errors in attribute names, argument types, and required inputs. |
| Terraform lint   | Performs static analysis of Terraform code to identify potential issues, such as deprecated syntax, unused variables, or non-idiomatic patterns.                           |
| Checkov          | A static code analysis tool for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), including Terraform. It scans Terraform configuration files for security and best practice issues.        |

## Terraform CD

For Terraform CD, I'm employing a streamlined approach to deployment using the terraform plan and terraform apply commands. These commands facilitate the automated deployment of infrastructure changes to the target environment. Here's a breakdown:

| Aspect           | Terraform CD                                                                                                                                              |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| terraform plan   | Generates an execution plan outlining the changes Terraform will apply to the infrastructure, including new resources, updated attributes, and deletions. |
| terraform apply  | Executes the planned changes in the Terraform configuration files, applying them to the target environment and automating the deployment process.        |

## Terraform best-practices when working with modules

| Best Practice                                              | Description                                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Modularization                                            | Break down infrastructure into small, reusable modules to promote code reuse, simplify maintenance, and facilitate collaboration.                      |
| Clear Module Purpose                                      | Ensure each module has a well-defined purpose, addressing a single concern (e.g., provisioning a specific service or configuring a component).         |
| Input and Output Variables                                | Use input variables to parameterize modules and output variables to expose relevant information for customization based on different use cases.         |
| Documentation                                             | Provide comprehensive documentation, including usage examples, input variable descriptions, and output variable details, to promote module adoption.    |
| Versioning                                                | Manage Terraform modules using version control (e.g., Git) and version them appropriately with tools like version tags, following semantic versioning.   |
| Testing                                                   | Implement automated testing to validate correctness and functionality using tools like Terratest or Kitchen-Terraform.                                  |
| Linting and Formatting                                    | Integrate linting (e.g., tflint) and formatting (e.g., terraform fmt) tools into the development workflow to enforce code style conventions and detect errors. |
| Dependency Management                                     | Explicitly declare dependencies between modules to ensure correct propagation of changes and prevent unintended side effects.                            |
| Use Case Specific                                         | Design modules to be generic for reuse across projects but specific enough to address common use cases, avoiding overly generic or specific implementations. |
| Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)      | Incorporate CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, validation, and deployment, ensuring thorough testing and controlled deployment of module changes.        |
| State Management                                          | Consider using a centralized, versioned state management solution (e.g., Terraform Cloud) to store and manage Terraform state files securely and collaboratively. |


## Conclusion
In conclusion, implementing robust CI/CD checks on Terraform modules is crucial for guaranteeing the reliability, security, and efficiency of your infrastructure as code (IaC). By following best practices and leveraging automation tools like Jenkins or Terraform Cloud, organizations can streamline development and deployment processes, demonstrably reducing deployment failures  and minimizing downtime.
