# Introduction

With the increasing complexity of modern networks and the need for agility in infrastructure management, Terraform has emerged as a powerful tool for automating the provisioning and configuration of network resources.This module is designed to provide a foundational framework for managing network infrastructure as code using Terraform. By leveraging this module, users can quickly establish a standardized and scalable network architecture within their cloud environment.In this document it will guide through the steps to achieve the setup of terraform module for infrastructure setup which involves the modules:

**VPC**

**Subnet**

**Route Table**

**IGW**

**NAT**

**Elastic IP**

**NACL**
