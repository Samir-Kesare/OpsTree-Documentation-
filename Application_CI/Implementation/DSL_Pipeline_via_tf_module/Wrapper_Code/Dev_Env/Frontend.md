## Introduction

With the increasing complexity of modern networks and the need for agility in infrastructure management, Terraform has emerged as a powerful tool for automating the provisioning and configuration of network resources.This module is designed to provide a foundational framework for managing network infrastructure as code using Terraform. By leveraging this module, users can quickly establish a standardized and scalable network architecture within their cloud environment.As networks get more complicated and managing infrastructure becomes more important, specialized languages called Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) have become really useful. They help simplify and automate different tasks.

## What is DSL Pipeline?

A Domain-Specific Language (DSL) is a programming language or specification language dedicated to a particular problem domain, a particular problem representation technique, and/or a particular solution technique.DSL Pipeline is a robust framework designed to facilitate the creation, deployment, and management of domain-specific languages within your software development projects. By employing DSLs, developers can express solutions in a concise, domain-specific syntax tailored to the problem at hand, thereby enhancing productivity and reducing the gap between domain experts and software implementation.

There are two main types of DSLs: external DSLs and internal DSLs. External DSLs have their own syntax and are typically parsed by a separate compiler or interpreter. Internal DSLs, on the other hand, are embedded within a host programming language, leveraging its syntax and features to create a domain-specific syntax.

## Why DSL Pipeline

| Key Features  | Description                                                                                                              |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Modularity**    | The DSL Pipeline offers a modular architecture, allowing developers to define and integrate custom DSL components seamlessly. |
| **Extensibility** | Extend the capabilities of the DSL Pipeline by incorporating new DSL constructs, transformations, and integrations with existing tools and libraries. |
| **Automation**    | Automate repetitive tasks in the development lifecycle through pipeline automation, including parsing, validation, transformation, and code generation. |
| **Flexibility**   | Accommodate diverse DSL requirements with flexible configuration options, support for various syntax styles, and compatibility with multiple target platforms. |
