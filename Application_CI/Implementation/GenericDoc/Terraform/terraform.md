## Infrastructure as Code(IaC)

<img width="360" length="100" alt="Terraform" src="https://github.com/CodeOps-Hub/Documentation/assets/156057205/fa9b30e5-bb65-4126-9f9b-e26c619b032a">

 Infrastructure as Code (IaC) simplifies server setup by using code instead of manual configurations. This makes provisioning infrastructure easier, more consistent, and reliable. It also helps manage changes to infrastructure over time.Additionally, IaC facilitates drift management, enabling seamless handling of changes to the infrastructure over time.

## Why Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

To better understand the advantages of Terraform, it helps to first understand the benefits of Infrastructure as Code (IaC). IaC allows developers to codify infrastructure in a way that makes provisioning automated, faster, and repeatable. Itâ€™s a key component of Agile and DevOps practices such as version control, continuous integration, and continuous deployment.
Infrastructure as code can help with the following:

| Benefit                           | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Improve speed**  | Automation accelerates provisioning and connectivity of resources, surpassing manual navigation through interfaces.                                          |
| **Improve reliability**              | Codifying infrastructure ensures consistent provisioning and configuration, reducing the likelihood of misconfigurations, especially in large setups.          |
| **Prevent configuration drift**       | Infrastructure as Code mitigates configuration drift by ensuring that the provisioned environment matches the declared configuration.                           |
| **Support experimentation/testing**  | Infrastructure provisioning becomes faster and easier, facilitating experimentation, testing, and optimization with minimal time and resource investments. |

## How Terraform Works

<img width="500" length="100" alt="Terraform" src="https://github.com/CodeOps-Hub/Documentation/assets/156057205/5204bc9d-faea-447a-8998-f58ba9488118">

| Step                           | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Terraform Initialize**          | Run `terraform init` in the project directory to set up Terraform, download provider plugins, and configure the backend for storing the infrastructure state file.  |
| **Terraform Validate**            | Use `terraform validate` to check Terraform files for syntax errors and configuration issues before applying changes.                                             |
| **Terraform Plan**                | Execute `terraform plan` to generate an execution plan, comparing desired state with current infrastructure and outlining proposed changes.                        |
| **Terraform Apply**               | Apply changes to infrastructure by running `terraform apply`, which provisions resources according to the plan and updates the state file.                           |
| **Terraform Destroy**            | Use `terraform destroy` to tear down the infrastructure, deleting all resources managed by Terraform. Exercise caution as this action is irreversible.               |

## Terraform Configuration Overview

| Topic                 | Description                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Configuration Files**   | Terraform uses configuration files written in HCL or JSON with a .tf extension. They define the desired state of infrastructure and include resource definitions, providers, variables, outputs, and modules. |
| **Providers**             | Providers are plugins for interacting with APIs of infrastructure and service providers. Terraform supports providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, etc. Each provider has its own set of resources managed by Terraform. |
| **Resources**             | Resources represent infrastructure components (e.g., virtual machines, networks) and are declared within configuration files to define the desired state. Terraform compares declared state with actual state and makes changes to achieve it. |
| **Variables**             | Variables parameterize configurations, enhancing flexibility and reusability. They can be defined within configuration files or passed from external sources like environment variables or files. |
| **Modules**               | Modules are reusable components encapsulating sets of resources and configurations. They promote code reuse and maintainability and can be shared via the Terraform Registry. |
| **State Management**      | Terraform maintains a state file recording the current infrastructure state. It's used for planning, applying changes, tracking dependencies, and managing concurrency. State can be stored locally, remotely (e.g., Terraform Cloud, AWS S3), or using `terraform state` commands. |
| **Commands and Workflows** | Terraform CLI provides commands for initializing, planning, applying, and destroying infrastructure. Common commands include `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`, and `terraform destroy`. Workflows typically involve project initialization, planning changes, applying changes, and optionally destroying resources. |

|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Version Control**                                | Utilize version control systems like Git to track changes to infrastructure code and facilitate collaboration. |
| **Testing**                                        | Implement testing methodologies to validate infrastructure configurations and prevent regressions.          |
| **Modularization**                                  | Organize infrastructure code into reusable modules to promote code reuse, maintainability, and scalability. |
| **Parameterization**                                | Use variables and parameterization to make configurations flexible and reusable across different environments. |
| **Security Best Practices**                        | Follow security best practices such as least privilege, encryption, and network segmentation in infrastructure designs. |
| **Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment** | Integrate Terraform into CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, validation, and deployment of infrastructure changes. |
| **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**                   | Embrace the principles of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate provisioning, configuration, and management of infrastructure. |
