Terragrunt is an open-source tool designed to make working with Terraform easier. Terraform itself is a widely-used infrastructure-as-code tool created by HashiCorp, used for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. While Terraform provides a powerful way to manage infrastructure, it can become complex to manage complex configurations across multiple environments and projects. Terragrunt simplifies this process to make your configurations less complex.

## Proof of Concept (POC) Guide:

 * It is highly recommended to gain hands-on experience through our detailed Proof of Concept (POC) guide for [Dependency-Check](https://github.com/avengers-p7/Documentation/blob/main/Application_CI/Design/03-%20Java%20CI%20checks/Dependency%20Scanning%20POC/README.md). This comprehensive document walks you through a practical demonstration, providing step-by-step instructions on setting up Dependency-Check for a sample project. The POC guide delves into essential concepts into identifying vulnerabilities within project dependencies.

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Scanning Frequency** - Regular scanning of project dependencies is essential for maintaining a secure development environment. Conduct dependency scans at key points in the development lifecycle, such as during the build process, before major releases, and after significant changes.
   
2. **Integration with Other Security Tools** - Enhance the effectiveness of your security strategy by integrating OWASP Dependency-Check with other security tools. This synergistic approach provides a more comprehensive security analysis. (eg, DAST , Container security )
   
3. **Handling False Positives** - False positives in dependency scanning results can occasionally occur. Here's how to handle them effectively. Leverage Dependency-Check's suppression mechanism to manage false positives, ensuring accurate reporting and engage with the Dependency-Check community to share and verify findings, improving the accuracy of future scans.
