# GitOps with Terraform 

## Introduction
The fusion of GitOps principles with Terraform technology marks a significant advancement in infrastructure management. GitOps emphasizes declarative infrastructure as code (IaC) stored in Git repositories, seamlessly integrating with Terraform's provisioning capabilities. This document explores how this symbiotic relationship enhances automation, scalability, and reliability in infrastructure workflows, offering insights into implementation strategies and best practices.

## GitOps

GitOps is a modern operational model for managing infrastructure and applications in a cloud-native environment. At its core, GitOps leverages Git as the single source of truth for defining and managing the desired state of infrastructure and applications. This means that all configurations, policies, and code are stored in a Git repository, allowing for version control, auditability, and collaboration.

The key principles of GitOps include:
- Declarative Configuration: Infrastructure and application configurations are defined declaratively, specifying the desired end-state rather than imperative commands for achieving that state.
- Version Control: Git repositories serve as the central repository for all configuration and code changes. This enables versioning, rollbacks, and collaboration among team members.
- Automated Synchronization: Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines are used to automatically synchronize the state of the infrastructure and applications with the configuration stored in Git. Changes made to the repository trigger automated actions to reconcile the actual state with the desired state.
- Immutable Infrastructure: Infrastructure is treated as code, and changes are made by modifying the configuration stored in Git rather than directly modifying running environments. This promotes consistency, repeatability, and scalability.
- Observability and Monitoring: GitOps encourages the use of observability tools and monitoring solutions to gain insights into the health and performance of infrastructure and applications. This helps in detecting and resolving issues quickly.

Overall, GitOps simplifies the management of complex systems, improves collaboration between development and operations teams, and enhances the reliability and scalability of cloud-native applications and infrastructure.

## How to GitOps your Terraform
There are several approaches to GitOps with Terraform, each offering unique benefits and considerations. Here are some common ways to implement GitOps for managing Terraform infrastructure:

### Direct Application of Terraform Configuration:

| **Method** | **Description** |
| Push-Based Deployment | Changes to Terraform configurations are directly applied to the infrastructure by pulling the latest configuration from the Git repository and running Terraform commands (e.g., terraform apply). |
| Manual Trigger | Changes are manually triggered by operators or developers, who push changes to the Git repository and initiate the deployment process. |

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Pipelines:
| **Method** | **Description** |
| CI/CD Pipelines | Use CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment of Terraform configurations. Changes pushed to the Git repository trigger the pipeline, which executes Terraform commands to apply the changes |
| Pipeline Orchestration Tools | Employ dedicated CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, or GitHub Actions to manage the Terraform deployment pipeline. These tools provide capabilities for versioning, testing, approval gates, and deployment automation. |

### GitOps Operators:
| **Method** | **Description** |
| Terraform Operators | Utilize GitOps operators designed specifically for Terraform, such as FluxCD with Terraform controller or ArgoCD with Terraform plugin. These operators continuously monitor the Git repository for changes and reconcile the desired state with the actual state of the infrastructure.
| Custom Operators | Develop custom operators tailored to your organization's requirements using tools like Kubernetes Operators SDK or Operator Framework. These operators can integrate with Git repositories and Terraform to automate infrastructure deployments within Kubernetes clusters. |

### Infrastructure Automation Frameworks:
| **Method** | **Description** |
| Custom Scripts and Automation |Develop custom scripts or use automation frameworks to implement GitOps workflows tailored to your organization's needs. This approach allows for flexibility in integrating Terraform with existing infrastructure automation processes and toolchains. |

Each of these approaches offers its own advantages and trade-offs in terms of complexity, scalability, flexibility, and level of automation. Organizations should evaluate their requirements, existing tooling, and infrastructure setup to determine the most suitable GitOps strategy for managing Terraform infrastructure effectively.
