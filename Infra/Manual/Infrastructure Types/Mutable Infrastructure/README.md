Mutable infrastructure refers to a traditional approach to managing IT infrastructure where servers and resources are modified or updated in place rather than being replaced entirely.
Changes or Updates are applied incrementally, meaning that only the specific components or configurations that need to be changed are modified. This allows for targeted updates without the need to replace entire server.
