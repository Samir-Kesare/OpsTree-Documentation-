## Introduction

Mutable infrastructure refers to a traditional approach to managing IT infrastructure where servers and resources are modified or updated in place rather than being replaced entirely.
Changes or Updates are applied incrementally, meaning that only the specific components or configurations that need to be changed are modified. This allows for targeted updates without the need to replace entire server.

***
## Key Benefits

* **Familiarity and Legacy Support:** Mutable infrastructure aligns with traditional IT management practices that many organizations are familiar with. It may also better support legacy systems or applications that are not easily adapted to immutable infrastructure patterns.

* **Operational Flexibility:** Mutable infrastructure allows for more flexibility in managing and adapting to changing requirements or environments. Administrators can make real-time adjustments and optimizations as needed without the need for full infrastructure replacements.

* **Reduced Overhead:** In some cases, mutable infrastructure may involve less overhead compared to immutable infrastructure, since in this case you would not typically destroy any component to incorporate any kind of update.

## Advantages and Disadvantages 

| Advantages                         | Disadvantages                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Your IT team does not need to build servers from scratch every time a change is required.            | **Inability to Rollback:** Rollback to a previous version or state can be challenging or impossible in mutable infrastructure setups, especially if changes are applied incrementally and not properly versioned or tracked. |
|Updates and changes can be applied incrementally, reducing the risk of unintended consequences or disruptions to services.  | **Complexity:** Debugging is time consuming due to update tracking problems. You could end up with several versions of an update without any insight into the problem.  |

## Best Practices 

1. **Automation with Configuration Management Tools:** Utilize configuration management tools such as Ansible, Chef, or Puppet to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure components. Automating repetitive tasks helps ensure consistency, reduces errors, and improves efficiency.

2. **Version Control:** Maintain version control for configuration files, scripts, and other infrastructure artifacts using a version control system like Git. This allows for tracking changes over time, rollback to previous versions if necessary, and collaboration among team members.

3. **Testing:** Implement testing practices, such as unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing, to validate changes before deploying them to production. Automated testing pipelines can help streamline the testing process and ensure the reliability of infrastructure changes.
