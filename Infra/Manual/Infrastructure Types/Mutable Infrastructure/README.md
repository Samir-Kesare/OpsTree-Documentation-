Mutable infrastructure refers to a traditional approach to managing IT infrastructure where servers and resources are modified or updated in place rather than being replaced entirely.
Changes or Updates are applied incrementally, meaning that only the specific components or configurations that need to be changed are modified. This allows for targeted updates without the need to replace entire server.

## Key Benefits

* **Familiarity and Legacy Support:** Mutable infrastructure aligns with traditional IT management practices that many organizations are familiar with. It may also better support legacy systems or applications that are not easily adapted to immutable infrastructure patterns.

* **Operational Flexibility:** Mutable infrastructure allows for more flexibility in managing and adapting to changing requirements or environments. Administrators can make real-time adjustments and optimizations as needed without the need for full infrastructure replacements.

* **Reduced Overhead:** In some cases, mutable infrastructure may involve less overhead compared to immutable infrastructure, since in this case you would not typically destroy any component to incorporate any kind of update.
