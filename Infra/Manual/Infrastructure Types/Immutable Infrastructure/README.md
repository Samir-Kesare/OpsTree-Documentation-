## Introduction

Immutable infrastructure is a modern approach to managing IT environments that emphasizes the use of immutable components, where server instances, containers, or virtual machines are treated as disposable, immutable artifacts that are never modified after they are created.

In immutable infrastructure, updates and changes are applied by replacing entire server instances or components with new ones that incorporate the desired changes, rather than modifying existing instances in place.

## Advantages and Disadvantages 

| Advantages                         | Disadvantages                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reuse existing configurations:** Your IT team does not need to build servers from scratch every time a change is required.            | **Inability to Rollback:** Rollback to a previous version or state can be challenging or impossible in mutable infrastructure setups, especially if changes are applied incrementally and not properly versioned or tracked. |
|**Incremental updates:** Updates and changes can be applied incrementally, reducing the risk of unintended consequences or disruptions to services.  | **Complexity:** Debugging is time consuming due to update tracking problems. You could end up with several versions of an update without any insight into the problem.  |

## Best Practices 

| Best Practice                                   | Description                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Automation with Configuration Management Tools | Utilize configuration management tools such as Ansible, Chef, or Puppet to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure components. Automating repetitive tasks helps ensure consistency, reduces errors, and improves efficiency. |
| Version Control                                | Maintain version control for configuration files, scripts, and other infrastructure artifacts using a version control system like Git. This allows for tracking changes over time, rollback to previous versions if necessary, and collaboration among team members. |
| Testing                                        | Implement testing practices, such as unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing, to validate changes before deploying them to production. Automated testing pipelines can help streamline the testing process and ensure the reliability of infrastructure changes. |
