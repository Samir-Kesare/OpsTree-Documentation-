Rolling out immutable infrastructure using a blue-green deployment strategy is a robust approach to ensure seamless updates with minimal downtime. Here's a high-level overview of how you can implement it:

1. **Setup Infrastructure**: 
   - Provision two identical environments: blue and green. These environments should include servers, load balancers, databases, etc.
   - Automate infrastructure provisioning using tools like Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, or similar.

2. **Deploy Initial Version (Blue)**:
   - Deploy your application to the blue environment.
   - Test the application thoroughly in the blue environment to ensure it's functioning as expected.

3. **Route Traffic to Blue**:
   - Configure your load balancer to direct all incoming traffic to the blue environment.

4. **Deploy New Version (Green)**:
   - Deploy the updated version of your application to the green environment. This version should include any changes or updates you want to introduce.
   - Automate deployment processes using CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.

5. **Test Green Environment**:
   - Conduct comprehensive testing in the green environment to verify that the new version works correctly and doesn't introduce any regressions.

6. **Gradual Traffic Shift**:
   - Gradually shift a portion of the incoming traffic from the blue environment to the green environment. This can be done by adjusting the load balancer's routing rules.
   - Monitor the green environment closely during this phase to ensure stability.

7. **Monitor and Validate**:
   - Monitor both blue and green environments for any issues or discrepancies.
   - Use monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or AWS CloudWatch to track key metrics.
   - Validate that the green environment is handling traffic effectively and meeting performance expectations.

8. **Complete Traffic Shift**:
   - Once you're confident in the stability and performance of the green environment, shift all incoming traffic to the green environment.
   - Retire the blue environment or keep it as a rollback option if needed.

9. **Post-Deployment Tasks**:
   - Perform any necessary post-deployment tasks such as database migrations, cache warm-up, or configuration updates.
   - Update documentation and notify stakeholders about the successful deployment.

10. **Continuous Improvement**:
    - Gather feedback from users and stakeholders.
    - Analyze performance metrics and identify areas for optimization.
    - Iterate on the process to make future deployments even smoother.

By following this approach, you can achieve a seamless deployment process with minimal disruption to your users, while also ensuring the reliability and consistency of your infrastructure.
