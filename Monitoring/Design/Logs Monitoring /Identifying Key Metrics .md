# Best Practices

* **Select Relevant Metrics:** Choose metrics that are relevant to your specific use case, focusing on those that provide actionable insights into system performance, reliability, and user experience.

* **Establish Baselines:** Establish baseline metrics to understand normal operating conditions and deviations from the norm, which can help in identifying anomalies and potential issues.

* **Set Thresholds and Alerts:** Define thresholds for critical metrics and configure alerts to notify stakeholders when thresholds are exceeded, enabling proactive issue detection and response.

* **Regular Review and Analysis:** Conduct regular reviews and analysis of metric data to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement, and adjust monitoring strategies accordingly.
