# Introduction

This document outlines the design considerations for creating a dashboard for application monitoring. A well-designed dashboard provides insights into system health, performance, and potential issues, helping users to effectively monitor logs and troubleshoot problems.

A dashboard for application monitoring metrics ensures that engineering teams can monitor the health, throughput, and performance of on-premise, hybrid, and cloud applications.

The dashboard also provides you with an in-depth analysis of crash trends on a weekly basis. With the added functionality of applying filters on widgets, you can easily narrow your search and gain valuable insights into your application's performance.

# Why
1. Enhanced Comprehension: Visual representation aids in understanding complex data quickly and intuitively.

2. Prompt Issue Resolution: Real-time updates enable immediate responses to emerging issues, minimizing downtime.

3. Relevant Insights: Customization ensures that users can prioritize and focus on metrics pertinent to their objectives.

4. Preventive Action: Proactive alerting allows teams to address issues before they escalate, maintaining optimal performance.

5. Informed Decision-Making: Historical data analysis provides insights into long-term trends, guiding strategic planning and optimization efforts.

# Components

| Component       | Description |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dashboard Layout        | Design a clear and intuitive layout with organized widgets. Prioritize essential information and avoid complexity. |
| Panels and Panel Options | Containers displaying visualizations with controls for customization. Panel options vary based on visualization type, allowing tailored visualizations. |
| Data Sources    | Entities containing data, such as SQL databases, Grafana Loki, Grafana Mimir, JSON-based APIs, or CSV files. Allows visualization of various data sources in one view. |
| Plugins         | Extend dashboard capabilities. Data source plugins that will collect the data from the source to dashboards using a unified data structure. |
| Queries         | Reduce data to a specific dataset for visualization. Each data source has its query language (e.g., PromQL, LogQL, SQL) to extract relevant information. |
| Transformations | Manipulate data returned by queries to meet specific requirements (e.g., combining fields, parsing data types, performing SQL-like operations). |

# Design Principle

| Principle                  | Description |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clarity of Purpose         | Clearly define the purpose of the dashboard to guide its design and content.|
| Relevance                  | Include only essential information that supports the dashboard's intent. |
| Efficient Visualization    | Choose visualizations that convey information quickly and effectively. |
| Grouping Metrics           | Organize related metrics together for easy navigation and comparison. |
| Consistency                | Maintain uniformity in visualizations and layouts to facilitate comparison. |
| Hierarchy                  | Use size and position to indicate the importance of data elements. |
| Clear Labels               | Use concise and descriptive labels to aid audience understanding. |
| Continuous Improvement     | Regularly review and update dashboards to ensure they drive desired behavior and outcomes. |

# Advantages

| Advantages           | Description                                                                                              |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Visualization   | Presents complex data in visually comprehensible formats for easier understanding.                      |
| Real-time Updates   | Provides real-time or near-real-time updates on app performance, aiding quick issue identification.       |
| Customization        | Allows customization to display relevant metrics tailored to specific needs, enhancing focus.            |
| Proactive Alerting   | Includes alerting capabilities to notify users of threshold breaches, enabling proactive issue resolution.|
| Historical Analysis  | Offers historical data for trend analysis, aiding in decision-making for capacity planning and optimization.|

# Disadvantages

| Disadvantages             | Description                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Information Overload      | Too many metrics or data points can overwhelm users, making it difficult to focus on key insights.          |
| Design Complexity         | Designing effective dashboards requires expertise in data visualization and user experience design.        |
| Maintenance Overhead      | Dashboards require ongoing maintenance to ensure that data sources are accurate and up-to-date.             |
| Cost                      | Developing and maintaining dashboards can incur costs in terms of software, infrastructure, and personnel.   |
| False Sense of Security   | Relying solely on dashboards for monitoring can lead to a false sense of security if important issues are overlooked.|
