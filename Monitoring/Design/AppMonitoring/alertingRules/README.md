## Introduction
Alert rules in app monitoring are predefined conditions or thresholds set up within a monitoring system to trigger notifications or alerts when certain criteria are met. These rules are essential for proactively identifying and addressing issues in an application or system.

## Why
| Aspect               | Description                                                                                                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Proactive Monitoring | Alert rules enable proactive monitoring by triggering notifications when specific conditions or thresholds are met. |
| Timely Issue Response | They ensure timely responses to potential issues, allowing teams to address problems before they escalate.         |
| Prevent Downtime     | By promptly notifying about anomalies or deviations from expected behavior, alert rules help prevent downtime.       |
| Resource Optimization| Alert rules help optimize resource allocation by identifying underutilized or overutilized resources in real-time.   |
| Enhanced Reliability | They contribute to maintaining system reliability and performance by identifying and resolving issues promptly.    |

These aspects highlight the importance of alert rules in app monitoring for maintaining system health, reliability, and performance.

## Components
| Component            | Description                                                                                                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Alert rules          | Define conditions triggering notifications when specific criteria are met.                                |
| Thresholds           | Specifies limits for metrics. Crossing these thresholds triggers alerts.                                             |
| Notification         | Alerts prompt notifications via email, SMS, or other channels to designated individuals or teams.                   |
| Escalation Policies  | Define actions if alerts remain unresolved, such as escalating to higher-level personnel or initiating remediation.|
| Customization        | Allows tailoring of alerting behavior, including adjusting thresholds and configuring multiple conditions.          |
