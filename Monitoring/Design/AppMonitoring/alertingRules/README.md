## Introduction
Alert rules in app monitoring are predefined conditions or thresholds set up within a monitoring system to trigger notifications or alerts when certain criteria are met. These rules are essential for proactively identifying and addressing issues in an application or system.

## Why

| Aspect               | Description                                                                                                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Proactive Monitoring | Alert rules enable proactive monitoring by triggering notifications when specific conditions or thresholds are met. |
| Timely Issue Response | They ensure timely responses to potential issues, allowing teams to address problems before they escalate.         |
| Prevent Downtime     | By promptly notifying about anomalies or deviations from expected behavior, alert rules help prevent downtime.       |
| Resource Optimization| Alert rules help optimize resource allocation by identifying underutilized or overutilized resources in real-time.   |
| Enhanced Reliability | They contribute to maintaining system reliability and performance by identifying and resolving issues promptly.    |

## Components

| Component            | Description                                                                                                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Alert rules          | Define conditions triggering notifications when specific criteria are met.                                |
| Thresholds           | Specifies limits for metrics. Crossing these thresholds triggers alerts.                                             |
| Notification         | Alerts prompt notifications via email, SMS, or other channels to designated individuals or teams.                   |
| Escalation Policies  | Define actions if alerts remain unresolved, such as escalating to higher-level personnel or initiating remediation.|
| Customization        | Allows tailoring of alerting behavior, including adjusting thresholds and configuring multiple conditions.          |

## Rules
Determining the specific alert rules for your application depends on various factors such as the type of application, its critical functionalities, expected user behavior, and the underlying infrastructure. However, here are some common alert rules that you may consider implementing:

| Metric                    | Threshold/Condition                                      | Alert Action                                             |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|

| Error Rate                | Exceeds a predefined threshold                           | Notify relevant team members for investigation           |
| Server CPU Utilization    | Exceeds a predefined threshold                           | Notify relevant team members for investigation           |
| Memory Usage              | Exceeds a predefined threshold                           | Notify relevant team members for investigation           |
| Disk Space                | Reaches a critical level                                  | Notify relevant team members for investigation           |
| Network Latency           | Exceeds a predefined threshold                           | Notify relevant team members for investigation           |
| Database Connection Pool  | Reaches a critical level or exceeds a limit              | Notify relevant team members for investigation           |
| HTTP Status Codes         | Consistently returns errors (e.g., 5xx codes)            | Notify relevant team members for investigation           |
| Security Events           | Anomalous activities detected (e.g., brute force attacks) | Notify security team for immediate action                 |
