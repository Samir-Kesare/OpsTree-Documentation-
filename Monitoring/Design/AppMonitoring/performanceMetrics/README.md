## Introduction 
Performance monitoring is critical for ensuring the optimal operation of applications. This documentation aims to identify key performance metrics and requirements essential for monitoring the performance of applications.
***
## What
API monitoring is the process of continuously checking for both the availability of your endpoints and the validity of their data exchanges. While monitoring your APIs, you also gain visibility into how your APIs operate in terms of performance (e.g., time to respond to a request made from various locations or to queries of increasing complexity).
***
## Why 

***
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to run SonarQube as a Cluster, it is only possible with a [Data Center Edition](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/setup-and-upgrade/install-the-server-as-a-cluster/)<br>
> Below, is an alternative approach with Sonarqube+AWS to provide HA.
