## Introduction 
Performance monitoring is critical for ensuring the optimal operation of applications. This documentation aims to identify key performance metrics and requirements essential for monitoring the performance of applications.
***
## What
API monitoring is the process of continuously checking for both the availability of your endpoints and the validity of their data exchanges. While monitoring your APIs, you also gain visibility into how your APIs operate in terms of performance (e.g., time to respond to a request made from various locations or to queries of increasing complexity).
***
## Why 
As with any critical infrastructure, APIs require careful monitoring to ensure optimal performance. Their efficiency directly affects user satisfaction, system reliability, and operational effectiveness. Neglecting monitoring can result in outages, congestion, and subpar service quality. Therefore, it's essential for organizations relying on APIs to prioritize understanding the key metrics that drive their performance.

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| **Response time** | is crucial for measuring API efficiency, indicating how quickly requests are processed. Factors affecting it include server performance, network delays, data payload, concurrent requests, and third-party dependencies.
| **Request rate** | reflects the load on an API within a timeframe, helping anticipate demand and prepare infrastructure. Peaks may stem from user behavior, scheduled operations, new feature releases, or outages.
| **Error rate** |measured by failed requests as a percentage of total, highlights issues like capacity overloads, buggy releases, infrastructure problems, or invalid client requests.
|**Latency**| measures the time for a data packet to travel to and from the server, affected by physical distance, network congestion, routing, and transmission medium. High latency can degrade user experience and reduce throughput.
| **Availability, or uptime,** | represents the operational time of an API. Strategies to maximize it include redundancy, regular maintenance, proactive monitoring, and load balancing.
| **Data throughput** | indicates the API's data handling capacity over time. Influenced by network bandwidth, server capacity, data compression, concurrency, and network latency, optimizing it enhances user experience and resource utilization. |
