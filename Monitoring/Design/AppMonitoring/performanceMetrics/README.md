## Introduction 
Performance monitoring is critical for ensuring the optimal operation of applications. This documentation aims to identify key performance metrics and requirements essential for monitoring the performance of applications.
***
## What
App monitoring is the process of continuously checking for both the availability of your endpoints and the validity of their data exchanges. While monitoring your apps, you also gain visibility into how your app operate in terms of performance (e.g., time to respond to a request made from various locations or to queries of increasing complexity).

As with any critical infrastructure, Apps require careful monitoring to ensure optimal performance. Their efficiency directly affects user satisfaction, system reliability, and operational effectiveness. Neglecting monitoring can result in outages, congestion, and subpar service quality. Therefore, it's essential for organizations relying on Apps to prioritize understanding the key metrics that drive their performance.
***
## Why 
Performance metrics are essential in App monitoring for several reasons:

1. **User Experience**: The performance of an App directly impacts the experience of end-users. Metrics such as response time and latency reflect how quickly requests are processed, influencing user satisfaction.

2. **System Reliability**: Monitoring performance metrics helps ensure that Apps are reliable and consistently available. Metrics like uptime and error rate provide insights into the stability of the system and help identify potential issues before they escalate.

3. **Operational Efficiency**: Efficient Apps contribute to overall operational efficiency by streamlining processes and reducing downtime. Monitoring performance metrics allows organizations to optimize resource allocation and identify areas for improvement.

4. **Proactive Problem Identification**: By tracking performance metrics in real-time, organizations can proactively identify and address issues before they impact users. This proactive approach minimizes disruptions and enhances system resilience.

5. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Performance metrics provide valuable data that can inform decision-making processes. By analyzing trends and patterns in metrics over time, organizations can make informed decisions about infrastructure investments, software upgrades, and optimization strategies.
