## Introduction 
Performance monitoring is a crucial aspect of managing systems, applications, networks, and various other components within an organization's IT infrastructure. It involves the continuous observation, measurement, and analysis of key metrics to assess the efficiency, reliability, and overall health of these systems.
The primary goal of performance monitoring is to ensure that systems operate optimally, meeting the required performance levels and delivering satisfactory user experiences. This involves identifying potential bottlenecks, addressing issues promptly, and optimizing resources to enhance performance and prevent downtime.
***
## What
Infrastructure monitoring is the practice of observing and tracking the performance, availability, and health of various components within an IT infrastructure. This includes servers, networks, databases, applications, and other critical systems. The primary goal of infrastructure monitoring is to ensure that all components are functioning optimally and to detect any issues or anomalies that may arise.
Infrastructure monitoring typically involves the use of specialized tools and software that continuously collect data from various sources within the infrastructure. This data is then analyzed, and alerts are generated when thresholds are exceeded or when abnormal behavior is detected. Monitoring can include metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, network traffic, response times, and error rates.
